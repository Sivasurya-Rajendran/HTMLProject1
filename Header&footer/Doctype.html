    <h2 id="intro"> What is html?</h2>
    <p >
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
        HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements.
        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.

    <button onclick="document.location= '#top'">Menu</button>
    <h2 id="basics"> Html Basics</h2>
    <p >
    The basic structure of an HTML document consists of 5 elements:
    <ol>
    <li>!DOCTYPE</li>
    <li>html</li>
    <li>head</li>
    <li>title</li>
    <li>body</li>
    </ol>     
    </p>
    <button onclick="document.location= '#top'">Menu</button>

    <h2 id="versions"> Html Version</h2>
    <p >
    1991- Tim Berners-Lee invents HTML 1.0
    1993- HTML 1.0 is released. Not many developers are creating websites at this time.
    1995- HTML 2.0 is published. This contains the features of HTML 1.0 plus new features. This remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until 1997.
    1997- HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett introduced a fresh draft on HTML, which improved new features of HTML and gave more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing websites. 
        Unfortunately, the powerful features slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
    1999- The widely-used HTML 4.0 comes out. It is very successful.
    2014- HTML 5.0 is released and used worldwide. It is said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in 2012.

    <h2 id="tags">Html Tags</h2>
    <p >
    HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content.
    With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content.
    HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. 
    But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.
    When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. 
    HTML tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties.

    <h2 id="sem"> Html Semantics</h2>
    <p>
    With over 100 HTML elements, and the ability to create custom elements, there are infinite ways to mark up your content; 
    but some ways—notably semantically—are better than others.
    Semantic means "relating to meaning". Writing semantic HTML means using HTML elements to structure your content based on each element's meaning, not its appearance.
